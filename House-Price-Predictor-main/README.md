#  House Price Predictor

A beginner-friendly machine learning web app that predicts the **median house value** in California based on basic housing features using a trained model and **Streamlit** for UI.

---

#  Dataset

- **Source:** California Housing Dataset (`housing.csv`)

---

#  Model

- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Regressor
- **Training Sample:** 5,000 random samples from the dataset
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Missing value handling
  - One-hot encoding for categorical column (`ocean_proximity`)
  - Feature scaling not required for tree-based models

---

#  Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.13
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- joblib
- streamlit

---

#  How to Run

1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Aditya13136/House-Price-Predictor/tree/master/House-Price-Predictor-main

cd house-price-predictor

2. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib streamlit

3. Train and save model
python model.py

4. Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py




# Notes 
The model is saved as saved_model/model.pkl

You can experiment with other regressors like Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, etc.

Input is taken via Streamlit sliders for a smooth experience
